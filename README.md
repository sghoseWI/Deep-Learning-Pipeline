# Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning Pipeline

This repository contains a robust script for paid and adaptable machine learning-based model creation. 

It is designed to aid in prediction and classification problems -- and includes both supervised and unsupervised algorithms, cross-validation techniques, as well as automated model performance evalalutation reporting.    

Methods: Neural Networks (Tensorflow + Keras), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest, KNN, Support Vector Machine Decision Tres, ExtraTreesClassifier, Logit, NaiveBayes, and Gradiant Boost.
